# CC's road to stardom

A text adventure to help CC find the road to stardom! (Adventuron game for TALP2022 Jam)

It's CC's birthday!
Will he be gifted his dream, to become the universe's biggest idol?
He's the cutest creature in the universe after all, so it would be fair.
If he doesn't, all his friends from the Cosmoose gang can help him. Maybe?

This is a small, heartwarming story you can play with your kids.

## How to play

This is a classical text adventure game.
To act, you need to input a VERB and a SUBJECT, or simply a VERB.

there are various synonyms accepted (or shortcuts, like X for EXAMINE).
You can GIVE or TAKE objects.
To move on the map, you can use the cardinal directions, NORTH, EAST, SOUTH and WEST 
(or shortcuts N, E, S, W); there are some places you can ENTER or EXIT.
